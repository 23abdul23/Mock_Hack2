      "*   **Remove Infected Parts:** Immediately remove and destroy (do not compost) any infected leaves, stems, or fruit to reduce the spread of bacteria.\n",
      "*   **Improve Air Circulation:** Prune lower leaves and ensure adequate spacing between plants to improve air circulation and reduce humidity around the foliage, which favors bacterial growth.\n",
      "*   **Water Properly:** Water plants at the base, avoiding overhead irrigation that splashes soil and bacteria onto leaves and keeps foliage wet. Water in the morning so leaves can dry quickly.\n",
      "*   **Crop Rotation:** Do not plant tomatoes or other susceptible crops (peppers, eggplant) in the same location for at least 2-3 years.\n",
      "*   **Sanitation:** Clean gardening tools after use, especially if they came into contact with infected plants. Remove all plant debris at the end of the season.\n",
      "*   **Resistant Varieties:** For future plantings, consider using tomato varieties that are resistant or tolerant to bacterial spot.\n",
      "*   **Seed Treatment:** If growing from seed, use certified disease-free seeds or consider a hot water seed treatment (though this requires careful temperature control).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Resources/Products:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Copper-based bactericides:** These are the primary chemical control for bacterial spot. They act as a preventative measure and can help manage existing infections, but will not cure severely infected leaves. Apply according to label instructions, especially during periods of wet, warm weather.\n",
      "*   **Biological Control Agents:** Some products containing *Bacillus subtilis* or other beneficial microbes can be used as a preventative spray to help suppress disease development.\n"
